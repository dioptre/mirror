# Avatar Mirror System - Execution Plan

## Project Overview
Real-time avatar mirror system that:
1. Detects and tracks people entering a room
2. Captures their best likeness when they arrive  
3. Reconstructs them as 3D avatars
4. Rigs the models for animation
5. Estimates poses in real-time
6. Streams to Godot for visualization
7. Optional real-time face swapping

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Assumptions
- Camera for person detection
- GPU acceleration recommended for 3D processing
- Redis server for caching
- Network connection to Godot instance

### Key Integration Points
1. **Ultra-Light-Fast-Generic-Face-Detector-1MB**: Face detection
2. **PIFuHD**: 3D human reconstruction  
3. **UniRig**: Automatic rigging
4. **TEMPO**: State-of-the-art pose estimation
5. **Background removal**: Clean input for reconstruction
6. **WebSocket**: Real-time communication with Godot

### Data Flow
Camera Input → Face Detection → Person Tracking → Quality Check → Background Removal → PIFuHD Reconstruction → UniRig Rigging → Cache Storage → WebSocket Notification → Pose Estimation Loop → Godot Visualization
